  <div class="mySlides">
    <p class="slide-title">Highly Recommend</p>
    <q>Without Ken's help, I'm not sure where we would be now. My husband is a disabled veteran and I had to retire suddenly due to his declining health. We were faced with a very tough decision. Ken walked us through the process with patience and professionalism you should expect from an attorney. Ken was available when we had questions and was always early for our appointments. I honestly can't say enough about the level of help he and his staff gave us . We now have the peace of mind that we need. We would highly recommend Ken to anyone seeking help for such a difficult situation. Thank you</q>

    <q>I asked my personal attorney for a referral to a specialist, and he recommended Kenneth Gallant. From our first meeting, to our last handshake, Ken was professional, knowledgable and very much involved with my case. He was always available, and made time for me when I needed it. I highly recommend him to anyone needing his services.</q>
